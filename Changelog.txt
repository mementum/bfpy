1.14
-- Corrected typo in bftimezone.py (Resolves issue #27)
-- Catch exception in time parsing if bogus time is received. This apparently affects people with non-funded accounts and the exception in time processing prevents the login error from being displayed (Resolves issue #26)

1.13
-- Float values to be sent to the server are capped to 2 decimal places (Resolves issue #19)
-- Nullified Array Processing reverted to abstract definition call to avoid clash (and unexpected exception) with API errors (Resolves issue #18)

1.12
-- DateTime management reworked to allow Local Timezones/UTC and aware/naive usage by applications (Resolves issue #13)
-- Returned objects are all named using the Bf provided name or a derived name (in compressed answers) (Resolves issue #15)
-- Restored createXXXX functionality, ex: createMarket, to retrieve objects (lost with the removal of suds) (Resolves issue #16)

-- Updated to HttxLib 0.97

1.11
-- Complete API Support via DirectAPI (Resolves issue #8)
-- Informative error message if ExchangeId is not passed to an Exchange call (Resolves issue #9)
-- Split Bf WSDL definitions into files for easier management (Resolves issue #10)
-- Corrected adjustment of marketTime to the local time zone (Resolves issue #3)
-- ApiDataTypes now support __copy__, which is used in the extended version of PlaceBets (Resolves issue #4)
-- Clones share data with original object regardless of cloning moment (Resolves issue #5)
-- Virtual Prices are supported (Resolves issue #6)
-- DirectAPI datetime objects sent in UTC format always. They were before directly translated to the given time regardless of the timezone (Resolves issue #7)
-- DataCounter uses now time.clock for Windows and time.time for other platforms to ensure throttling problems under Unix/Linux systems (Resolves issue #11)
-- Vendor API call getSubscriptionInfo available as getSuscriptionInfoVendor to avoid conflict with the call of the same name (Resolves Issue #12)
-- All returned datetimes are now adjusted to the localtime (Resolves issue #13)
-- Updated to HttxLib 0.96

1.10
-- Implemented Software Vendor API Services
-- Small changes to improve Python 2.5 compatibility (HttxLib not yet)

1.02
-- ApiParam descriptor now works as data attritubute and method, removing the need to recognize it outside of the DirectAPI library part
-- Post Processing for Market split into parts to remove DirectAPI dependency
-- Simplified data charges weight counter calculations and removed any DirectAPI dependency
-- Only the processors ArrayFix and ArrayUnfix need to take DirectAPI into account in comparison to suds
-- Generalized the Soap parsing of custom defined types with callbacks
-- Added support to plug in external (user-defined) calls (suds and/or DirectAPI) calls by adding a module called bfextern

1.01
-- Corrected data counter implementation to support the DirectAPI

1.00
-- DirectAPI tested under Bfplusplus.

-- Implemented the services used by Bfplusplus with the directApi
-- Removed suds dependencies if only the directApi is wished to be used

0.82
-- Adapted (and adopted) object printing code from suds to let the on-the-fly-created "EmptyObjects" (example: response in getAllMarkets) to be printed and therefore easily see the references
-- Added a Data Counter and Throttler for the data charges calls. Default max requests per second: 20, to comply with Betfair's policy. Cloned BfApi/BfClient instances (usually in a multi-threaded environment) share the data counter

0.81
-- Added default asianLineId (0) value for getMarketTradedVolumeCompressed
-- Added daylight correction for getAllMarkets
-- Included httxlib
-- Added GetPriceTicks (Up/Down and Bet dependent) to get price increments from a price

-- Save currency of the account in "currency" member
-- Added an array "Exchanges" to the module with the list of available exchanges

0.78
-- Final correction to suds non-DST datetime. Removed GMT and UTC timezone classes

0.77
-- Corrected the placeBets hack
-- Patched suds to let it work in a multithreaded environment with clones, by avoiding cloning circular references
-- bfpy working in MacOS in multithreaded environment with clones

0.76
-- Changed MinBets to be able to retrieve an individual field instead of the object with the different types of minbets
-- MarketTuple no longer defined in this library
-- Re-introduced proxy assignment (if passed as arg) to transport during BfClient instantiation
-- Corrected getMinStakes. As staticmethod it can't reference a self
-- Corrected clone. It was clearing the session token of the cloned object and not that of the clone
-- Added NO_RESULTS as coded error to skip in getMUBets
-- Corrected getMarketProfitAndLoss post-processing logic to raise an exception
-- Removed 2 leftover print statements used during debugging

0.75
-- Version number bumped
-- Full re-implementation with non-data descriptor
-- Naming conventions camelCase for variables and functions/methods. Modules all lowercase and classes are CamelCase
-- All methods now have the same name as the Betfair service
-- All Exchange services must have the exchangeId as the first parameter
-- In all services all other parameters must be named parameters (defaults are provided in many cases)
-- Added a getMinStakes method
-- re-login functionality implemented within the login method itself
-- No longer are BfPythonError exceptions raised (the class has not been removed)
-- Test units added
-- Imports re-ordered in the BfTransport module
-- getCompleteMarketPricesCompressed left out of re-implementation
-- getMarketPrices not implemented and no longer an alias to getMarketPricesCompressed
-- getCurrentBets has now betStatus MU as a default value

   as stubs

0.51
-- softwareVendorId added as a member of the Betfair class
-- Changes to the transport for better proxy/useragent support
-- Moved "suds" to the same level as bfpy. This avoids using any special import technique to make the transport load into suds
-- Changed the timezones to have a Local Timezone (following Python examples

0.50
