1.02
-- ApiParam descriptor now works as data attritubute and method, removing the need to recognize it outside of the DirectAPI library part
-- Post Processing for Market split into parts to remove DirectAPI dependency
-- Simplified data charges weight counter calculations and removed any DirectAPI dependency
-- Only the processors ArrayFix and ArrayUnfix need to take DirectAPI into account in comparison to suds
-- Generalized the Soap parsing of custom defined types with callbacks
-- Added support to plug in external (user-made) calls (suds and/or DirectAPI) calls by adding a module called bfextern

1.01
-- Corrected data counter implementation to support the DirectAPI

1.00
-- DirectAPI tested under Bfplusplus.
-- Implemented a correction for ArrayFix to enable fixing if no results are sent by Betfair
-- Updated HttxLib to 0.94

0.99
-- Moved globals to a file to avoid __ini__ pollution
-- Implemented directApi call construction
-- Implemented the services used by Bfplusplus with the directApi
-- Removed suds dependencies if only the directApi is wished to be used

0.82
-- Adapted (and adopted) object printing code from suds to let the on-the-fly-created "EmptyObjects" (example: response in getAllMarkets) to be printed and therefore easily see the references
-- Added a Data Counter and Throttler for the data charges calls. Default max requests per second: 20, to comply with Betfair's policy. Cloned BfApi/BfClient instances (usually in a multi-threaded environment) share the data counter

0.81
-- Added default asianLineId (0) value for getMarketTradedVolumeCompressed
-- Added daylight correction for getAllMarkets
-- Included httxlib
-- Added GetPriceTicks (Up/Down and Bet dependent) to get price increments from a price
-- Error protection for some calls before attempting a split on a string (like getCompleteMarketPricesCompressed and getMarketTradedVolumeCompressed)
-- Added non-capitalized alias (price) for "Price" in bestPricesToBack and bestPricesToLay
-- Save currency of the account in "currency" member
-- Added an array "Exchanges" to the module with the list of available exchanges

0.80
-- Added all missing Account Management calls
-- Improved default parameters for any calls with a time parameters (from->to)

0.79
-- Added all API services except Account Management (getAccountFunds and TransferFunds were already included)
-- Added support for outgoing arrays Unfixing for all calls that needed it (betting calls were already beinf Unfixed)

0.78
-- Final correction to suds non-DST datetime. Removed GMT and UTC timezone classes

0.77
-- Corrected the placeBets hack
-- Patched suds to let it work in a multithreaded environment with clones, by avoiding cloning circular references
-- bfpy working in MacOS in multithreaded environment with clones

0.76
-- Changed MinBets to be able to retrieve an individual field instead of the object with the different types of minbets
-- MarketTuple no longer defined in this library
-- Re-introduced proxy assignment (if passed as arg) to transport during BfClient instantiation
-- Corrected getMinStakes. As staticmethod it can't reference a self
-- Corrected clone. It was clearing the session token of the cloned object and not that of the clone
-- Added NO_RESULTS as coded error to skip in getMUBets
-- Corrected getMarketProfitAndLoss post-processing logic to raise an exception
-- Removed 2 leftover print statements used during debugging

0.75
-- Version number bumped
-- Full re-implementation with non-data descriptor
-- Naming conventions camelCase for variables and functions/methods. Modules all lowercase and classes are CamelCase
-- All methods now have the same name as the Betfair service
-- All Exchange services must have the exchangeId as the first parameter
-- In all services all other parameters must be named parameters (defaults are provided in many cases)
-- Added a getMinStakes method
-- re-login functionality implemented within the login method itself
-- No longer are BfPythonError exceptions raised (the class has not been removed)
-- Test units added
-- Imports re-ordered in the BfTransport module
-- getCompleteMarketPricesCompressed left out of re-implementation
-- getMarketPrices not implemented and no longer an alias to getMarketPricesCompressed
-- getCurrentBets has now betStatus MU as a default value
-- nonInPlay re-placement of bets kept in placeBets, but to be removed in future versions

0.53
-- Added currency functions (ConvertCurrency, GetAllCurrencies, GetAllCurrenciesV2)
-- Added a staticmethod to retrieve minimum bets per currency
-- Improved the non-HttxLib transport (for independent usage) HTTP 1.1 Keep-alive can't be implemented due to the restrictions on urllib2
-- Moved utility object definitions to a util module

0.52
-- Added eypdoc documentation for the entire library
-- Full param set for GetCurrentBets (with defaults)
-- Full param set for GetMatchedAndUnmatchedBets (with defaults)
-- Full param set for GetMarketProfitAndLoss (with defaults)
-- Suds replica transport now has setuseragent and setdecompmethods
   as stubs

0.51
-- softwareVendorId added as a member of the Betfair class
-- Changes to the transport for better proxy/useragent support
-- Moved "suds" to the same level as bfpy. This avoids using any special import technique to make the transport load into suds
-- Changed the timezones to have a Local Timezone (following Python examples

0.50
-- First public commit to GoogleCode
